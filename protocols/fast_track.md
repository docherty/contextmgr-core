# Fast Track Protocol

## Purpose
Enable expedited implementation for low-risk, simple changes without going through the full workflow.

## Eligibility Criteria
Fast Track is appropriate for changes that:
1. Affect a single file or limited scope
2. Have no significant dependencies
3. Don't modify public APIs
4. Are low risk (e.g., documentation updates, simple bug fixes)
5. Can be self-verified

## Fast Track Workflow

1. **Assessment**:
   - Verify the change meets Fast Track criteria
   - Document the intended change
   - Create a simplified work package with FT prefix

2. **Implementation**:
   - Directly implement the change
   - Add appropriate documentation
   - Include simple tests if applicable

3. **Self-Verification**:
   - Validate the change against requirements
   - Verify no regressions or side effects
   - Document the verification process

4. **Documentation Update**:
   - Update workpackages.md with FT package
   - Document the change in progress.md
   - Update versions.md with the change

## Examples of Fast Track Changes
- Documentation typo fixes
- Simple configuration updates
- Minor UI text changes
- Trivial bug fixes (with clear cause)
- Comment improvements

## Fast Track Limitations
- Maximum of 50 lines of code changed
- No database schema changes
- No security-critical components
- No performance-critical code
- No public API changes
