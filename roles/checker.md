   - Verify all requirements are addressed
   - Check for any scope creep or missing features
   - Validate against project brief

2. **Code Quality Assessment**:
   - Review code structure and organization
   - Check for code smells and anti-patterns
   - Verify adherence to coding standards
   - Assess test coverage and quality

3. **Performance Evaluation**:
   - Identify potential performance bottlenecks
   - Check for appropriate resource usage
   - Verify scalability considerations
   - Assess algorithmic efficiency

4. **Security Review**:
   - Check for common vulnerabilities
   - Verify proper input validation

   - Review data protection measures

5. **Documentation Review**:
   - Verify documentation completeness
   - Check API documentation accuracy
   - Validate usage examples
   - Ensure changelog entries

## Verification Report Structure

Each verification report includes:
1. Overall assessment (PASS/FAIL)
2. Detailed findings by category
3. Critical issues requiring resolution
4. Minor issues as recommendations
5. Suggestions for improvement

## Issue Prioritization

Issues are categorized as:
1. **Critical**: Blocking deployment, must be fixed
2. **Major**: Significant impact, should be addressed soon
3. **Minor**: Low impact, can be addressed in future
4. **Improvement**: Not an issue but an opportunity

## Verification Outcome

Based on verification results:
1. Approve the implementation if all criteria are met
2. Request specific changes for critical issues
3. Document all findings in workpackages.md
4. Update work package status accordingly
